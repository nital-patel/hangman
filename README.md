# Hangman Game

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses.

## Rules
Choose one person to be the executioner. That person will think of a word and mark out blanks (short lines) for each letter of each word. Then another player will guess a letter. If that letter is in the word then write the letter in everywhere it would appear, and cross out that letter in the alphabet. If the letter isn't in the word then add a body part to the gallows (head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg). The player will continue guessing letters until they can either solve the word (or phrase) or all six body parts are on the gallows.

The executioner wins if the full body is hanging from the gallows. The guesser(s) wins if they guess the word before the person is hung.
